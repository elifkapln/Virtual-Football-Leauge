# Virtual-Football-Leauge 
A simple, menu-based virtual league application was developed with object-oriented programming logic.

Basic work blocks such as reading team and football coach names from the file, creating nicknames for teams, creating teams by generating football player information, creating league fixtures, determining the winning rates of teams and generating match scores were carried out.

Team and coach names are read from a file named '[footballTeams.txt](https://github.com/elifkapln/Virtual-Football-Leauge/files/8884783/footballTeams.txt)'.
Player names and surnames are randomly generated from the information in the '[playersNames.txt](https://github.com/elifkapln/Virtual-Football-Leauge/files/8884790/playersNames.txt)' and '[playersLastnames.txt](https://github.com/elifkapln/Virtual-Football-Leauge/files/8884791/playersLastnames.txt)' files.
